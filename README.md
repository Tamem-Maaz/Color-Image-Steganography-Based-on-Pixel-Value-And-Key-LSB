# Color-Image-Steganography-Based-on-Pixel-Value-And-Key-LSB
Pixel-value differencing (PVD) based steganography is one of popular approaches for secret data hiding in the spatial domain. 

When I am working on this algorithm, I found error in it, when you want to return the text from the image.
For that, I was fixed this error by putting some variables in the end of the image using LSB algorithm.
I wrote the full code of algorithm with android and C#. And, you will find the full documentation.
